<h2>Tech Kit - UL Compsoc - 2020/21 Semester 2</h2>
<p>This is some programming advice I have picked up along the way.</p>
<p>As a recommended practice always upload a blank sketch to your Arduino before connecting any other devices to avoid any unpredictable results. A blank sketch has empty setup() and loop() functions.</p>

<p>Always compiles first, thats the first progress bar. Then it attempts to upload the firmware (code) to the device. When it has worked it will say 'Done Uploading' on the turquoise bar.</p>
<p>Some advice from a video I watched, occasionally you get an error (apparently), espcomm_send_command warning _failed - unplug and plug back in generally works again.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MN9-_hOpf_c">I watched the first 7 minutes of this really cool kid doing this stuff</a></p>
