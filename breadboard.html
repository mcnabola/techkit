<h2>Tech Kit - UL Compsoc - 2020/21 Semester 2</h2>
<p>The breadboard interested me on exploring it first. It is built with major extensibility in mind. If you notice the clips on one side and the space for clips on the other. A similar feature is seen on the top and bottom. Clips and space for clips.</p>

<p>What is the sticky tape used for? attaching it to a wall if you decide o use the air quality monitor on a fixed surface. </p>

<p>In the first paragraph above I described how there are clips on the side and the top, well lets describe the breadboard by dividing it in two parts. 

The pin area and the main area. Well the pin areas are detachable too, so if you wanted a pin area of length 8 instead of 4 you could attach another main area and then reatach the pin area again. Ultimate versatility.</p>

<p>Also we should probably get the proper terminology for the parts of a breadboard, and describe it properly how the same signal is sent across the 4 pins in the main area. How all of the 1 line in the pin area is power and ground.</p>
