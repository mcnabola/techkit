<h2>Tech Kit - UL Compsoc - 2020/21 Semester 2</h2>
<p>Included in the TechKit you will find a USB to micro usb cable. This article is to enlighten you to a little known fact. Not all USB cables facilitate data transfer. Since most cables are sold with smartphones that faciliate data transfer from your phone to PC many of us have been led to believe that all cables support data transfer.</p>

<p>Of course the one that is included does support data transfer. This is just to make you aware that if you did happen to break/lose the default cable and you attempt to connect the ESP to your PC with another cable and it does not work, try another cable that you know does allow transfer and power transfer.</p>

<p>Can I learn more? How do I test it? <a href="https://www.dignited.com/50330/usb-data-cable-vs-usb-charging-cable/">For more info</a> To test it, plug in a device that uses the micro usb cable, does the file manager recognise the new device? or does it only charge.</p>
