<p>There is a good bit of confusion out there in regards to ESP8266. That term ESP8266 means nothing by itself there are many different types of ESP8266's out there. I only realised today that we have a ESP8266 with a shield attached.</p>

<p>The ESP8266 was launched in 2014 and is rapidly growing in popularity. There is only one ESP8266 processor but it is found on many different breakout boards. These all differ in terms of which pins are exposed and the size of the flash memory etc. These breakout boards have evolved rapidly over the years and there is a lot of information to be found on the web. This is both a blessing and a curse as some of the advice is outdated or just plain wrong.<a href="https://www.instructables.com/ESP8266-WiFi-Module-for-Dummies/">source</a> Some people get lucky, some have hassle.</p>
