<h2>Handling & Opening componenti </h2>
<p>Handling electronic components is something you want to always be careful of. In this case since we dont have spares we dont want to make any careless mistakes that can be prevented.</p>

<p>Opening the packages, look for the little indent along the top of the plastic that indicates exactly where to wrip across. Be careful that when you are doing this you are aware of where your hands and fingers are. YOu could easily put too much pressure on the components when you are focusing on opening the plastic. Have your fingers on the side. Or the components on the table and your fingers only on the top</p>
<p>When taking components out similarly as above you want to be careful of not putting pressure on the components. Also dont do it on top of your knee, do it on your desk so if a component falls out suddenly it will not fall on the floor. Admittely this happened to me :/</p>
<p>Do not be scared of these things either, the above is advice but they do generally have a good level of durability</p>

<p>Antistatic, do I have to be worried. in Ireland we are pretty safe from general antistatic problems. I wouldnt say you need to use one of those antistatic wristbands. If you do feel cautious you could have a steel surface nearby and touch every so often.</p>

<p>What kind of surface should I work on? I am working on a wooden table and its safe enough. Working on top of a mouse mat?(not sure) on top of paper?should be fine. in general just a piece of advice if you have loose paper and many other trinets all around your desk causing clutter they could be a place for components to go missing and cause hassle.</p>

<p>After you have finished working on the components put them back in the antistatic bags they come with. Keeps them safe and less chance of getting left on your desk and something wrong happens to them.</p>

<p>Removing the usb cable from the ESP, the cable is tightly connected into the port. I prefer not to pull from the USB side just in case it dislodges the usb port soldered onto the board. I keep my thumb and index finger on the edges of the board and pull backward.(Just a tip I found works)</p>
