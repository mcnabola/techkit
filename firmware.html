<p>A lot of websites reccomend reflashing the firmware. Thankfully we do not have to worry about this in the slightest. However I am going to write this article to bring awareness to the terminology in regards to the ESP8266.</p>

<p>We will replace the default firmware with our code. If you program the ESP8266 with your own code, you do not need factory firmware. Your code is the firmware.</p>

<p>AT Commands: These are the default commands that you can interact with the ESP if you did not decide to add your own code. With the AT commands you can do a lot of stuff with the ESP such as restarting, connecting to the Wifi, changing hte mode of operations and so on, much more is detailed here<a href="https://www.electronicshub.org/esp8266-at-commands/"></a>. Thanfully as we are able to program we can instead write our own commands and much more.</p>


<p>If you ever wanted to flash the ESP back to the factory default. I am only including this here for you to research or to know it can be done for whatever reason. You will never realistically need to do this.<a href="https://www.instructables.com/The-Simple-Guide-to-Flashing-Your-ESP8266-Firmware/">source</a>I have not followed this tutorial so I do not know if this is the best or uptodate way of doing this.</p>
